Here's a quote from a wonderful show (HeaderLvl2)

>“The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things. The good things don’t always soften the bad things, but vice versa, the bad things don’t always spoil the good things and make them unimportant.”
> ###— The Doctor, Season 5, Episode 10 (HeaderLvl3)

#### Coding "Hello, World!"
    
If you want to get "Hello, World!" to work in Visual Studio when you're writing in C++, you need to use the following code:
    
`#include "stdafx.h"`
    
`#include <iostream>`
    
`using namespace std;`
    
`void main()  {cout << "Hello, World!"; }`
